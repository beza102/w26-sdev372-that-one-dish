# Project Overview
## Project Name
That One Dish

## Tagline
Track the dishes worth remembering and share them with friends.

## Problem Statement
People often remember a dish they loved but forget the restaurant name, location,
or details of the meal. Existing apps like notes, photo galleries, or social media
do not organize these food memories effectively. This makes it difficult to revisit
favorite dishes, recommend meals to friends, or recall personal food experiences.

## Solution
That One Dish lets users save photos of dishes along with key details such as
restaurant name, location, cuisine, and personal notes. Users can log dishes from
restaurants they visit or add standalone dishes for cooking inspiration. All
entries are organized in a gallery view and can be shared with friends through
collaborative boards or lists.

## Target Users
- Food lovers who want to keep track of meals they enjoyed
- Students and young professionals who eat out frequently
- Travelers who want to remember restaurants from different cities
- Friends who want to share food recommendations
